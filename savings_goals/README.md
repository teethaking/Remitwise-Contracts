# Savings Goals Contract

A Soroban smart contract for managing savings goals with fund tracking, locking mechanisms, and goal completion monitoring.

## Overview

The Savings Goals contract allows users to create savings goals, add/withdraw funds, and lock goals to prevent premature withdrawals. It supports multiple goals per user with progress tracking.

## Features

- Create savings goals with target amounts and dates
- Add funds to goals with progress tracking
- Withdraw funds (when goal is unlocked)
- Lock/unlock goals for withdrawal control
- Query goals and completion status
- Access control for goal management
- Event emission for audit trails
- Storage TTL management

## Quickstart

This section provides a minimal example of how to interact with the Savings Goals contract.

**Gotchas:**
- Amounts are specified in the lowest denomination (e.g., stroops for XLM).
- If a goal is `locked = true`, you cannot withdraw from it until it is unlocked.
- By default, the contract uses paginated reads for scalability, so ensure you handle cursors when querying user goals.

### Write Example: Creating a Goal
*Note: This is pseudo-code demonstrating the Soroban Rust SDK CLI or client approach.*
```rust

let goal_id = client.create_goal(
    &owner_address,
    &String::from_str(&env, "University Fund"),
    &5000_0000000,                          
    &(env.ledger().timestamp() + 31536000)  
);

```

### Read Example: Checking Goal Status
```rust

let goal_opt = client.get_goal(&goal_id);

if let Some(goal) = goal_opt {

}

```

## API Reference

### Data Structures

#### SavingsGoal

```rust
pub struct SavingsGoal {
    pub id: u32,
    pub owner: Address,
    pub name: String,
    pub target_amount: i128,

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Goal

```rust
// Create an education savings goal
let goal_id = savings_goals::create_goal(
    env,
    user_address,
    "College Fund".into(),
    5000_0000000, // 5000 XLM
    env.ledger().timestamp() + (365 * 86400), // 1 year from now
);
```

### Adding Funds

```rust
// Add 100 XLM to the goal
let new_amount = savings_goals::add_to_goal(
    env,
    user_address,
    goal_id,
    100_0000000
);
```

### Managing Goal State

```rust
// Lock the goal to prevent withdrawals
savings_goals::lock_goal(env, user_address, goal_id);

// Unlock for withdrawals
savings_goals::unlock_goal(env, user_address, goal_id);

// Withdraw funds
let remaining = savings_goals::withdraw_from_goal(
    env,
    user_address,
    goal_id,
    50_0000000
);
```

### Querying Goals

```rust
// Get all goals for a user
let goals = savings_goals::get_all_goals(env, user_address);

// Check completion status
let completed = savings_goals::is_goal_completed(env, goal_id);
```

## Events

- `SavingsEvent::GoalCreated`: When a goal is created
- `SavingsEvent::FundsAdded`: When funds are added
- `SavingsEvent::FundsWithdrawn`: When funds are withdrawn
- `SavingsEvent::GoalCompleted`: When goal reaches target
- `SavingsEvent::GoalLocked`: When goal is locked
- `SavingsEvent::GoalUnlocked`: When goal is unlocked

## Integration Patterns

### With Remittance Split

Automatic allocation to savings goals:

```rust
let split_amounts = remittance_split::calculate_split(env, remittance);
let savings_allocation = split_amounts.get(1).unwrap();

// Add to primary savings goal
savings_goals::add_to_goal(env, user, primary_goal_id, savings_allocation)?;
```

### Goal-Based Financial Planning

```rust
// Create multiple goals
let emergency_id = savings_goals::create_goal(env, user, "Emergency Fund", 1000_0000000, future_date);
let vacation_id = savings_goals::create_goal(env, user, "Vacation", 2000_0000000, future_date);

// Allocate funds based on priorities
```

## Security Considerations

- Owner authorization required for all operations
- Goal locking prevents unauthorized withdrawals
- Input validation for amounts and ownership
- Balance checks prevent overdrafts
- Access control ensures user data isolation

## Migration Compatibility

The Savings Goals contract provides first-class support for off-chain data export
and migration through the `data_migration` crate. This covers four serialisation
formats and includes cryptographic integrity checking.

### On-chain API

| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `export_snapshot(caller)` | Exports all goals as a `GoalsExportSnapshot` (version + checksum + goal list). Caller must authorize. |
| `import_snapshot(caller, nonce, snapshot)` | Imports a validated snapshot, replacing contract state. Caller must authorize. Nonce prevents replay attacks. |

### Off-chain formats (via `data_migration`)

| Format | Helper (export) | Helper (import) | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| JSON | `export_to_json` | `import_from_json` | Human-readable; includes checksum validation |
| Binary | `export_to_binary` | `import_from_binary` | Compact bincode; includes checksum validation |
| CSV | `export_to_csv` | `import_goals_from_csv` | Flat tabular; for spreadsheet tooling |
| Encrypted | `export_to_encrypted_payload` | `import_from_encrypted_payload` | Base64 wrapper; caller handles encryption layer |

The `build_savings_snapshot` helper (in `data_migration`) wraps a
`SavingsGoalsExport` payload into a fully-checksummed `ExportSnapshot` for any
target format.

### Security assumptions

- **Checksum integrity**: Every snapshot carries a SHA-256 checksum over the
  canonical JSON of the payload. Any mutation after export is detected by
  `validate_for_import` → `Err(ChecksumMismatch)`.
- **Version gating**: Snapshots with an unsupported schema version are rejected
  by `validate_for_import` → `Err(IncompatibleVersion)`.
- **Nonce replay protection**: `import_snapshot` requires a monotonically
  increasing nonce per caller; reusing a nonce is rejected on-chain.
- **Authorization**: Both `export_snapshot` and `import_snapshot` require
  `caller.require_auth()`.
- **Encrypted path**: The `Encrypted` format uses base64 as a transport
  envelope. Callers are responsible for applying actual encryption (e.g. AES-GCM)
  to the serialised bytes before passing them to `export_to_encrypted_payload`.

### Example: full JSON roundtrip

```rust
// 1. Export on-chain state
let snapshot: GoalsExportSnapshot = client.export_snapshot(&admin);

// 2. Convert to data_migration format
let export = SavingsGoalsExport {
    next_id: snapshot.next_id,
    goals: snapshot.goals.iter().map(|g| SavingsGoalExport {
        id: g.id,
        owner: format!("{:?}", g.owner),
        name: g.name.to_string(),
        target_amount: g.target_amount as i64,
        current_amount: g.current_amount as i64,
        target_date: g.target_date,
        locked: g.locked,
    }).collect(),
};

// 3. Build migration snapshot (computes checksum)
let mig_snapshot = build_savings_snapshot(export, ExportFormat::Json);

// 4. Serialize to JSON bytes
let bytes = export_to_json(&mig_snapshot).unwrap();

// 5. (transmit bytes off-chain ...)

// 6. Import and validate
let loaded = import_from_json(&bytes).unwrap(); // validates checksum + version
```

### Running migration tests

```bash
# data_migration package (format-level e2e tests)
cargo test -p data_migration

# savings_goals package (contract + cross-package e2e tests)
cargo test -p savings_goals
```
